# Snippetbox

This project is based on the excellent book "Let's Go" by Alex Edwards. I have followed the tutorial to build a Go web application and added my own customizations.

## Project Overview

Snippetbox is a simple web application that allows users to create, view, and manage code snippets. The application is built using the Go programming language and follows best practices for web development.

## Features

- User authentication and authorization
- Create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations for code snippets
- Syntax highlighting for code snippets
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop users
- Secure handling of user data
